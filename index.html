<p>1.In Japan, origami has inspired a lot of art, fashion, food, and even architecture! If you visit, try to find all the buildings based on origami style. Hint: there’s a lot.
    There are more than a dozen National Origami Associations throughout the world.<br>

    <br>2.Akira Yoshizawa is considered the Grand Master of modern Origami. He created over 50,000 origami models, invented wet-folding, and developed a method of diagramming origami instructions.
  <br> <br> 3.The Guinness Book of World Records has dozens of entries for origami from most folds, to smallest and biggest and more! Can you guess the fastest time for folding 100 cranes?
    The fastest time to make 100 origami cranes is 40 minutes 35 seconds, achieved by Yoneyama Yuichi (Japan) in Nagoya, Japan, on 30 November 2010. That’s an average of 24.35 seconds for each crane!
    
    <Br><br>4.Initially, the art of paper folding was restricted only to ceremonial occasions because paper was scarce and expensive.

  <br> <br>5. Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).

  <br>  <br>6.An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish. Feeling lucky?
 
 <br><Br> 7. No scissors allowed! Traditional origami uses a piece of paper in the shape of a square. Up to the challenge?
